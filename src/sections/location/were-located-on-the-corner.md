        Being one of Atlanta’s hottest in-town neighborhoods, it makes it super
        easy to get to work. My husband (and fellow designer) bikes or runs here
        every day, and I’m able to scoot home at lunch to let the dogs out.

        I love working across the street from the Atlanta Beltline because it
        reminds me of my home in New York. There’s walkability, art, culture,
        and taking a walk is a great way to clear my head during the workday.

        I love that Inman Park is just down the street from the office. It has a
        small neighborhood vibe while still being in an urban setting. There are
        so many quaint shops and restaurants I can go to after work for a treat.

        I eat lunch at Ponce City Market entirely too much. It’s a perfect storm
        of “I need to get away from my desk” and “I don’t know what I want to
        eat for lunch” because it’s across the street and has something for
        whatever mood I’m in.
