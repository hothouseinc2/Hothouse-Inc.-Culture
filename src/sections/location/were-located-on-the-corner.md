        Being one of Atlanta’s hottest in-town neighborhoods, it makes it super
        easy to get to work. My husband (and fellow designer) bikes or runs here
        every day, and I’m able to scoot home at lunch to let the dogs out.

        I love that Inman Park is just down the street from the office. It has a
        small neighborhood vibe while still being in an urban setting. There are
        so many quaint shops and restaurants I can go to after work for a treat.
